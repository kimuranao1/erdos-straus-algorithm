# erdos-straus-algorithm
An algorithm to explore the ErdÅ‘sâ€“Straus conjecture using integer partitioning in Python.
# ErdÅ‘sâ€“Straus Conjecture Algorithm This project explores the **ErdÅ‘sâ€“Straus Conjecture**, which states that for any integer `n â‰¥ 2`, the fraction `4/n` can be expressed as the sum of three positive unit fractions:
4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z


## ðŸ§  Algorithm Overview This algorithm searches for valid `(x, y, z)` triples by: - Scaling both sides of the equation to avoid fractions. - Splitting the numerator into three additive parts. - Converting each part into the denominator of a unit fraction. - Verifying the sum using Python's `fractions.Fraction` module for precision. ## ðŸ’¡ Example Output
n=3, x=1/3, y=1/2, z=1/2
n=4, x=1/3, y=1/2, z=1/6
